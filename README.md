# bw6-utilities-plugin
The `bw6-utilities-plugin` is designed to simplify common configuration management tasks for TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition (BWCE) and BusinessWorks 6 (BW6) projects. It provides goals for automatic token replacement in substitution variable files (`.substvar`) and for extracting configuration variables into standard `.properties` files.
